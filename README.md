# Kevin Kwan's Portfolio

## Description

This is the source code for Kevin Kwan's personal portfolio website. The website is a testament to my front-end development skills, showcasing proficiency in **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **TailwindCSS** and other modern web technologies. 

The portfolio includes various projects that I have worked on, demonstrating his ability to create **responsive designs**, **interactive user interfaces**, and **accessible web components**. Each project in the portfolio highlights different aspects of front and back-end development, providing a comprehensive view of my capabilities.

## Live Demo
